This project aims to define and explain the utility of swagger-maven-plugin and demonstrate how it can quickly generate a swagger.json/swagger.yml file and use it instead of using a bench of Java objects as models.
As you can see here, it's a maven project that contains some models (which I want to transform to a swagger API, so when I have something to update I will always return to the Swagger) this package swagger-maven-plugin/src/main/java/com/ecom/ber/api/models/
